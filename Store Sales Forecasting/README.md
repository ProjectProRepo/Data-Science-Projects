# Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting

## Overview
This data science project aims to build a robust machine learning model to forecast daily sales for Rossmann stores across Germany. Store managers currently rely on manual estimates, leading to inconsistencies. By leveraging historical sales data along with external factors such as promotions, competition, holidays, and seasonality, we can improve sales forecasting accuracy, allowing better staffing and inventory management.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of historical sales data for **1,115 stores** over several years. It includes:
- **Store Information**: ID, type, competition distance, and opening dates.
- **Sales Data**: Daily sales figures and customer count.
- **Promotional Data**: Whether a promotion was running on a given day.
- **Holiday and Event Data**: State and school holidays affecting sales.

#### Source:
The dataset is publicly available on **Kaggle's Rossmann Store Sales** competition.

## Tech Stack
This project utilizes the following technologies and libraries:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, LightGBM

## Project Workflow
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

### **1. Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
- Load and inspect the dataset.
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Convert categorical features into numerical form.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Create new features such as sales trends, holiday impact, and lag variables.
- Perform feature selection to retain the most important variables.

### **3. Data Visualization**
- Generate heatmaps and correlation plots.
- Explore sales patterns across different stores and seasons.

### **4. Model Development**
- Train models including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Decision Trees**
- Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.

### **5. Model Evaluation**
- Compare model performance using RMSE and MAE.
- Assess feature importance and interpret results.

### **6. Deployment & Business Insights**
- Generate final predictions for unseen data.
- Provide actionable insights for store managers.

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, users will:
- Gain experience in handling time-series sales data.
- Learn techniques for feature engineering and model tuning.
- Understand how ML models can optimize business decisions.

## Learning Takeaways
- Handling missing values and outliers in real-world datasets.
- Importance of feature engineering in time-series forecasting.
- Comparison of different regression algorithms for prediction.
- Practical implementation of **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.**
