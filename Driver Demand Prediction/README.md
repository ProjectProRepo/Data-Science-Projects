# Demand Prediction of Driver Availability using Multistep Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This data science project focuses on predicting the future availability of delivery drivers in specific geographic areas using **multistep time series forecasting** techniques. Driver availability is a crucial factor in optimizing logistics and maintaining consistent delivery experiences. Inaccurate forecasting often results in surge pricing, delayed deliveries, and revenue losses due to cart abandonment.

By transforming a time-series forecasting problem into a supervised learning task, we apply machine learning models to forecast driver online hours for multiple time steps ahead. The project demonstrates the power of **recursive multistep prediction**, **ensemble models**, and **feature engineering** for temporal data.

## Dataset

The dataset is derived from an **online food delivery platform**, focusing on driver activity logs. It contains timestamped records of the **number of hours each delivery executive is online** in a given location. The dataset is pre-aggregated at hourly intervals and contains the following key attributes:

- `datetime`: Timestamp of driver activity (hourly)
- `area_id`: Encoded identifier for a service area
- `online_driver_hours`: Total hours drivers were available in that hour

Additional time-based features such as **day of the week**, **weekend flag**, and **hour of day** are created during preprocessing.
