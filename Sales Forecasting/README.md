#  Sales Forecasting Data Science Project

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for Walmart stores using historical data. The goal is to build a forecasting model that helps Walmart optimize inventory planning, staffing, and overall revenue management. The dataset contains information about 45 Walmart stores, including sales trends, markdown events, store type, size, and economic indicators like CPI, fuel prices, and unemployment rates.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple files providing structured data on store operations:
- **train.csv**: Contains historical sales data for different stores and departments.
- **features.csv**: Includes additional information like fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), unemployment rate, and markdown events.
- **stores.csv**: Provides details about store types and their sizes.
- **test.csv**: Contains future weeks for which sales predictions need to be made.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `forecast`, `caret`, `randomForest`

## Project Workflow
### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Understanding the dataset structure and variables
- Univariate and bivariate analysis to detect trends and anomalies
- Visualization of sales trends using `ggplot2`

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values in markdown and economic indicators
- Identifying and treating outliers
- Encoding categorical variables
- Merging multiple datasets into a single analytical frame

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Creating new variables from existing data (e.g., holiday sales impact, moving averages)
- Extracting time-based features (week, month, year) to capture seasonality
- Identifying the impact of markdown events on sales

### 4. Model Building & Training
- **Baseline Models**: Simple statistical techniques like moving averages and exponential smoothing
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- **Time Series Models**:
  - ARIMA for forecasting future sales
  - SARIMA for handling seasonality

### 5. Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to evaluate model performance
- Hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis for model interpretation

### 6. Prediction & Business Insights
- Predicting weekly sales for each department in a store
- Evaluating the effect of markdowns and holidays on sales
- Generating actionable insights for inventory and staffing planning

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand Walmart's sales trends and their influencing factors
- Learn feature engineering techniques for time series data
- Build and compare different forecasting models
- Develop strategies to improve sales prediction accuracy

## Learning Takeaways
- **EDA techniques**: Using `ggplot2` and `dplyr` for visualization
- **Handling missing values and outliers**
- **Building predictive models**: Random Forest, XGBoost, ARIMA
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Grid search and cross-validation
- **Time series forecasting**: Using ARIMA and SARIMA
