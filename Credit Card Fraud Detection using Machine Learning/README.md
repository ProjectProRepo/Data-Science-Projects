# Credit Card Fraud Detection Data Science Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. With financial fraud becoming increasingly sophisticated, this project aims to build a robust classification model that can differentiate between genuine and fraudulent transactions. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, requiring careful handling of class distribution to improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
**Source:** The dataset consists of transactions made by European credit cardholders in September 2013, collected as part of a research collaboration between Worldline and the Machine Learning Group at Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles (ULB).

**Key Attributes:**
- **Time:** Seconds elapsed between the first transaction and the current transaction.
- **Amount:** Transaction amount.
- **V1 - V28:** Anonymized features resulting from PCA transformation.
- **Class:** Target variable (0: Non-Fraud, 1: Fraud).

**Dataset Characteristics:**
- **Total Transactions:** 284,807
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** 492 (~0.172%)
- **Imbalance Ratio:** Highly skewed towards non-fraudulent transactions

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.10.4
- **Libraries:**
  - `numpy`, `pandas` - Data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` - Data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` - Machine learning models and preprocessing
  - `imbalanced-learn` - Handling class imbalance

   - **Baseline Model:** Random Forest Classifier
   - **Logistic Regression:** Interpretable model
   - **Ensemble Techniques:** Random Forest for improved generalization
   - **Non-Linear Models:** SVM, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors
   
6. **Model Evaluation & Validation**
   - Cross-validation for robust performance assessment
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - ROC Curve & AUC for evaluating class separation
   - Learning curves for model behavior analysis
   
7. **Model Selection & Deployment Considerations**
