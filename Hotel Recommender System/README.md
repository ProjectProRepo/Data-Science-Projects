# Expedia Hotel Recommendations Data Science Project

## Overview
Planning a vacation can be overwhelming with countless hotel options at every destination. Expedia aims to simplify this by providing personalized hotel recommendations. This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a customer booking one of 100 different hotel clusters based on user search behavior and historical booking data. 
By applying various machine learning techniques, we contextualize customer data and enhance Expediaâ€™s recommendation system.

## Dataset
Expedia has provided anonymized logs of customer behavior, including:
- User search parameters
- Interactions with search results (clicks/bookings)
- Travel package information
- Historical hotel cluster formations

**Key Files:**
- `train.csv` - Training data containing user interactions from 2013 and 2014.
- `test.csv` - Test data containing booking events from 2015.
- `destinations.csv` - Extracted features from hotel reviews.

**Important Attributes:**
- `user_id` - Unique identifier for a user.
- `orig_destination_distance` - Distance between the customer and hotel.
- `is_booking` - 1 if the event is a booking, 0 if it's a click.
- `hotel_cluster` - The target variable (hotel cluster ID).

## Tech Stack
This project leverages the following technologies:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN)
