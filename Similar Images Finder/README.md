# Build a Similar Images Finder with Python, Keras, and TensorFlow

## Overview

In this project, you will build a deep learning-based Similar Image Finder that allows users to input a product image and retrieve visually similar images from a large product image dataset. This system is highly applicable to e-commerce, digital asset management, and visual search use cases.

Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and MobileNet-based feature extraction, you'll create a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) solution that efficiently searches over a high-dimensional embedding space with the help of Elasticsearch KNN plugin.

## Dataset

**Source**: [iMaterialist Fashion Product Dataset 2019 on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-product-2019/overview)

**Summary**:
- 1,011,532 training images  
- 10,095 validation images  
- 90,834 testing images  
- 2,019 product categories  
- Each image has a unique URL (users must download them manually or via script)

**Note**: Image URLs may become invalid over time, so itâ€™s recommended to download and archive images as soon as possible.

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras (MobileNet)
- **Similarity Search**: KNN, Elasticsearch (with KNN plugin)
- **Data Handling**: Pandas, NumPy, Requests
- **Utilities**: Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Django (for web deployment)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (optional for Elasticsearch hosting)

## Project Workflow

### 1.Data Preparation
- Download images from URLs using Python scripts  
- Organize images by category/SKU

### 2.Feature Extraction
- Use pre-trained **MobileNetV2** model from Keras  
- Extract deep feature embeddings from images

### 3.Building a High-Dimensional Database
- Normalize and store extracted vectors
- Understand ANN libraries and vector databases

### 4.Setting up Elasticsearch for KNN
- Install and configure Elasticsearch with KNN plugin  
- Index feature vectors using Elasticsearch APIs

### 5.Connecting to Elasticsearch
- Establish connection using `elasticsearch-py`  
- Push vector data and test queries

### 6. Similarity Search
- Perform image-to-image search using KNN over embeddings  
- Return top-K similar images based on cosine similarity

### 7.Web Interface (Optional)
- Build a Django web interface  
- Upload image and display similar results
