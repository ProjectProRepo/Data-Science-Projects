## Build a Recommender System for Market Basket Analysis using Association Rule Mining

## Overview
When shopping on eCommerce platforms, you’ve likely noticed the "frequently bought together" section. This feature is powered by Market Basket Analysis, which uncovers hidden relationships between products to drive sales and enhance customer experience. By analyzing historical transaction data, retailers can identify which items are often purchased together and use this knowledge to optimize product recommendations and increase revenue.
Market Basket Analysis, also known as association analysis, is a powerful technique used to uncover purchasing patterns and relationships between items in retail. It plays a crucial role in understanding customer behavior, enabling retailers to optimize cross-selling strategies and drive revenue growth. This project leverages advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and association rule mining to build a recommender system that offers actionable insights into frequently bought together items.
## Aim
To carry out comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis and implement Market Basket Analysis using association rule mining, ultimately building a recommender system that provides actionable insights for retail strategy.

## Project Objectives
- **Automate EDA and Market Basket Analysis:** Perform comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis and implement Market Basket Analysis using association rule mining.
- **Derive Actionable Insights:** Identify customer purchasing patterns, trending items, deals of the day, and top item combinations.
- **Build a Recommender System:** Develop a system that recommends products based on historical transaction data, empowering online retail platforms to boost sales.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this project, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of Python and data science fundamentals.
- Familiarity with libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib.
- An understanding of association rule mining and EDA concepts.

## Data Description
The dataset is a transnational data set containing all transactions from a UK-based, non-store online retail company for the years 2010 to 2011. It covers information about 500K customers across eight attributes, including transaction details, product information, and customer demographics. This rich dataset forms the backbone for performing in-depth Market Basket Analysis.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, collections, mlxtend, wordcloud, networkx

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and its significance in retail data analysis.
- Learn data cleaning and preparation techniques essential for accurate analysis.
- Gain insights into Market Basket Analysis and visualize customer purchasing patterns.
- Perform detailed date-time and free items analysis to identify deals of the day and trending items.
- Implement and validate the Apriori algorithm using mlxtend to extract association rules.
- Visualize the derived association rules using networkx for clearer insights into item relationships.

## Approach
- **Data Description:** Examine and document the dataset’s structure and key attributes.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct detailed EDA to uncover customer insights, analyze date-time patterns, review free items, and perform item-level analysis.
- **Data Cleaning:** Detect and treat missing values and outliers to ensure high-quality data.
- **Market Basket Analysis:** Identify frequent item sets and extract association rules.
- **Apriori Algorithm:** Implement the Apriori algorithm using mlxtend to generate and validate association rules.
- **Visualization:** Use wordclouds to highlight overall trends and networkx to visualize the network of item relationships.
- **Outcome Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the recommender system based on the clarity and relevance of the insights generated.
