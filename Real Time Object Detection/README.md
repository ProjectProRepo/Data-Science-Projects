# Real-Time Fruit Detection

## Overview
Real-time object detection is a crucial technology in various industries, enabling businesses to automate processes, enhance efficiency, and improve decision-making. In agriculture, real-time fruit detection helps automate harvesting, optimize yield estimation, and improve quality control. Retail businesses use it for inventory management, while supply chain and logistics companies leverage it for automated sorting and tracking.

This project implements real-time fruit detection using deep learning models, allowing accurate identification and classification of fruits from live camera feeds. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, this solution can be deployed in smart farming systems, automated fruit-sorting machinery, or mobile applications for fruit recognition.
## Project Objectives
