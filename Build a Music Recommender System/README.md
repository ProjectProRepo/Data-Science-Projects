# Build a Music Recommender System in Python

## Overview
This project focuses on building a Music Recommendation System using Machine Learning. The goal is to predict the likelihood of a user listening to a song again after their first noticeable listening event. We use the KKBox dataset, which contains user listening history, song metadata, and user information, to train and validate various machine learning models.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from KKBox, Asia’s leading music streaming service. It consists of three main files:

- **train.csv**: Contains user-song interaction details (~7.3 million rows)
- **songs.csv**: Contains metadata about songs (~2.2 million unique songs)
- **members.csv**: Contains user-related information (~34,403 users)

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `sklearn`, `xgboost`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## Project Workflow
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Data visualization
   - Insights into user behavior and song preferences
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Outlier treatment
   - Feature engineering
   - Encoding categorical data
3. **Model Building & Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBoost Classifier
4. **Model Validation**
   - Train-test split
   - ROC-AUC score evaluation
   - Feature importance analysis
5. **Prediction & Recommendation**
   - Generating song recommendations based on trained models

## Expected Outcomes
- Understand the user’s music listening behavior
- Learn feature engineering techniques for recommendation systems
- Build and compare multiple machine learning models
- Generate song recommendations based on historical listening data

## Learning Takeaways
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas and Seaborn
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Building classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model validation techniques (ROC-AUC, feature importance)
- Deploying a music recommendation algorithm
