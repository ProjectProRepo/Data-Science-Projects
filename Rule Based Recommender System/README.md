# Rule Based Recommender System for Beginners

## Overview
This project focuses on building a rule-based recommender system using Python. Recommender systems are algorithms designed to predict user preferences and suggest items accordingly. These systems are widely used in e-commerce, entertainment, and social media platforms to improve user experience and boost engagement. In this project, we will explore the basics of a recommendation system, its importance, and build a simple rule-based recommendation model. We will also explore various types of recommender systems including content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid methods.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a transactional data set from an online retail store. It contains information about customer purchases from 01/12/2010 to 09/12/2011 for a UK-based, non-store online retailer specializing in unique gifts. This dataset is available in the UCL Machine Learning Repository. 

### Key Attributes:
- **InvoiceNo**: Unique invoice number for the transaction
- **StockCode**: Unique identifier for each product
- **Description**: Description of the product
- **Quantity**: Quantity of items purchased
- **InvoiceDate**: Date of purchase
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit of the product
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Country**: Country of the customer

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations
  - `seaborn`: For data visualization
  - `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Description
We begin by loading the dataset and understanding its structure. We look at the number of transactions, customer details, and product descriptions. This gives us an overview of the dataset and prepares us for the next steps.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
During this phase, we analyze the data to uncover insights such as:
- The most popular products
- Customer purchasing patterns
- Regional preferences (if applicable)
We will visualize key metrics such as product frequency and customer purchase behavior using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

### 3. Data Cleaning
Next, we clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting any inconsistencies. This step is essential to ensure the quality of the data before feeding it into our recommendation system.

### 4. Rule-based Recommendation System
A rule-based recommender system works by defining rules based on the dataset to suggest items to customers. We build this system to recommend items based on factors like:
- **Popular items globally**
- **Popular items by country**
- **Popular items by month**
- **Items often bought together (Market Basket Analysis)**
We apply these rules to suggest items to customers based on their past purchases.

### 5. Popular Item Recommendations
We analyze the transaction data to identify:
- **Globally popular items**: Products that have been frequently bought across all customers
- **Country-specific popular items**: Items that are trending in specific countries
- **Month-wise popular items**: Seasonality trends that can influence purchasing behavior
These insights can be used to suggest items to customers based on global or regional trends.

### 6. Buy Again Prediction
Using the data, we can predict which products a customer is likely to buy again. This is based on their historical purchasing behavior, and it is one of the key use cases of recommender systems in e-commerce platforms.

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, users will:
- Understand the basics of recommender systems and their applications
- Learn how to implement a rule-based recommender system using Python
- Gain experience in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and model development
- Develop an understanding of how to analyze and visualize product trends
- Build a foundation for exploring more advanced recommendation techniques like collaborative filtering or deep learning-based recommender systems.

## Learning Takeaways
Through this project, you will learn:
- The different types of recommender systems (e.g., rule-based, collaborative filtering, content-based, hybrid)
- Techniques for building a recommendation engine using real-world transactional data
- How to preprocess and clean data for machine learning
- Insights into how recommendation systems can drive engagement and revenue in business applications
