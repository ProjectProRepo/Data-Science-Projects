# Build an Image Classifier for Plant Species Identification

## Overview

Imagine you’re planning to start your own tea-leaves business and need to price them based on quality. With our plant classifier, you can automatically identify plant species from leaf images—a key step in determining quality. Leaves, due to their unique characteristics, serve as effective indicators for differentiating plant species. This project provides a fun and practical introduction to image-based feature extraction and classification techniques in Python. In this machine learning project, you'll build an image classifier to accurately identify plant species using binary leaf images and their extracted features—such as shape, margin, and texture. By applying a range of benchmark classification techniques, you will gain hands-on experience in image processing, feature extraction, and machine learning model evaluation.

## Project Objectives
- **Understand the Problem:** Grasp the intricacies of plant species identification and the importance of image-based features.
- **Data Import & EDA:** Learn how to import datasets, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extract valuable insights using functions like `info()` and `describe()`.
- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Label encode necessary columns.
  - Compare data splitting techniques such as StratifiedShuffleSplit versus Simple Random Sampling.
  - Standardize and normalize the dataset, comparing results before and after preprocessing.
- **Benchmark Classification Techniques:** 
  - Implement and perform on-spot checking with classifiers including Linear, Non-linear, bagging, and boosting methods.
  - Apply models like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes.
  - Use hyperparameter tuning (grid search) to refine each model.
- **Evaluation Metrics & Visualization:** 
  - Define and apply evaluation metrics, such as Log Loss.
  - Perform Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).
  - Plot graphs for accuracy and loss versus classifier performance.
- **Model Selection & Final Prediction:** 
  - Analyze the confusion matrix and its importance.
  - Select the best model for prediction.
  - Make final predictions and save the results.
## Plant Data Used in This Project
The dataset is divided into four files:
- **train.csv:** Contains training data with features such as:
  - `id` – a unique identifier for each image.
  - `margin_1` to `margin_64` – 64 attribute vectors for the margin feature.
  - `shape_1` to `shape_64` – 64 attribute vectors for the shape feature.
  - `texture_1` to `texture_64` – 64 attribute vectors for the texture feature.
  - `Species` – the species label for each image.
- **test.csv:** Contains test data with similar feature structure.
- **sample_submission.csv:** A template for final predictions.
- **images:** A folder containing about 990 binary leaf images (approximately 10 images per each of the 99 plant species).

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** 
  - Data Handling: pandas, numpy
  - Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib, wordcloud, networkx
  - Machine Learning: scikit-learn, mlxtend
  - Deep Learning: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook/VS Code for interactive coding and exploration

## Expected Outcomes
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain a deep understanding of EDA, data cleaning, and preprocessing techniques for image-based datasets.
- Master various classification algorithms including KNN, SVC, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaptive Boosting, Naive Bayes, LDA, and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis.
- Learn how to apply hyperparameter tuning and evaluate models using Log Loss and confusion matrices.
- Explore the power of deep learning by building a CNN-based plant species classifier using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Develop practical skills to build a robust plant identification system, from feature extraction to final prediction and result saving.

## Important Notes
- **Dataset Limitations:** With 990 images across 99 species, the dataset is modest in size. It is ideal for benchmarking and learning but may require augmentation or transfer learning techniques for production-level accuracy.
- **Library Versions:** Ensure that your Python libraries are up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
- **Resource Requirements:** Training deep learning models (e.g., CNNs) may require GPU support. Consider using platforms like Google Colab or AWS EC2 instances if local resources are limited.

## Next Steps
- **Optimize the Pipeline:** Refine your data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning processes for improved performance.
- **Deep Learning Integration:** Enhance your classifier by experimenting with transfer learning using pre-trained CNN models.
- **Application Development:** Consider building a web or mobile application that leverages this plant species classifier for real-time plant identification.
- **Expand Modalities:** Explore incorporating additional image features or multi-modal data (e.g., textual descriptions) to further boost accuracy.
