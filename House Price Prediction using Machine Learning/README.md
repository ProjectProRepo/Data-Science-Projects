# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Predicting house prices is a crucial task in real estate and finance. Zillow's Zestimate model provides an estimate of home values, but it comes with an error margin. This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the log error between the Zestimate and the actual sale price, thereby improving the accuracy of price predictions. By leveraging regression techniques and advanced feature engineering, this project demonstrates how data science can enhance property valuation.

## Dataset

### Zillow Zestimate Dataset (Kaggle)
- The dataset consists of two CSV files containing approximately 60 features related to property attributes, location, and market conditions.
- The final dataset is formed by merging these files, resulting in ~90,000 rows and 60 columns.
- The target variable is `logerror`, defined as:
  
  ```
  logerror = log(Zestimate) - log(SalePrice)
  ```

### Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Identifying numerical and categorical variables
- Detecting and treating outliers
- Exploring feature relationships with the target variable

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, XGBoost, Joblib

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Import required libraries
- Read and merge datasets
- Handle missing values and duplicate entries
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering (scaling, encoding, new feature creation, redundant feature removal)
- Address multi-collinearity by removing highly correlated features
- Identify and treat outliers

### 2. Model Building
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Implement various regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regressor
  - Elastic Net
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
  - Adaboost Regressor
  - XGBoost Regressor

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Cross-validation to prevent overfitting

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use **GridSearchCV** to optimize model parameters
- Identify the best-performing model

### 5. Feature Importance Analysis
- Identify features that contribute most to predictions
- Assess how the target variable depends on input features

### 6. Final Model & Predictions
- Select the best model based on performance metrics
- Generate house price predictions with optimized parameters

## Expected Outcomes
- **Improved Zestimate Accuracy:** Reduce the log error in house price predictions.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Understand key factors affecting house prices.
- **Hands-On Machine Learning Application:** Practical experience in real estate analytics.

## Learning Takeaways
- End-to-end machine learning workflow for regression tasks
- Feature engineering techniques for improving predictive accuracy
- Model selection and hyperparameter tuning
