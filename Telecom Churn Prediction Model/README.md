# Predict Churn for a Telecom Company using Logistic Regression

## Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical business problem in the telecom sector. In this project, we analyze customer data to predict the likelihood of churn using logistic regression in R. The goal is to identify key drivers leading to churn, enabling businesses to take proactive steps to retain customers.

Key objectives of this project:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset
- Identify missing values and handle datatype inconsistencies
- Conduct feature engineering and transformation
- Implement logistic regression and compare with other models
- Optimize model performance using hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy the trained model for production use

## Dataset
The dataset consists of customer records from a telecom company in the US. It contains various features that help in predicting customer churn.

### **Key Features:**
- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company
- **Contract Type**: Monthly, One-year, or Two-year contract
- **Monthly Charges**: Amount billed to the customer each month
- **Total Charges**: Cumulative amount paid by the customer
- **Payment Method**: Various payment types such as credit card, bank transfer, etc.
- **Churn**: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `ggplot2`: Data visualization
  - `dplyr`: Data manipulation
  - `caret`: Machine learning model training and evaluation
  - `glm`: Logistic regression model implementation

## Project Workflow
1. **Understanding the Data**
   - Load and inspect the dataset
   - Identify missing values and outliers
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Univariate analysis for numeric and categorical variables
   - Bi-variate analysis to detect redundancy and correlations
   - Probability Distribution Function (PDF) visualization

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Create meaningful new features
   - Convert categorical variables into numeric representations
   - Normalize/standardize features as needed

4. **Data Preparation for Modeling**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Handle class imbalance if necessary
   
5. **Model Implementation**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Compare with other models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest)
   - Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Confusion matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - AUC-ROC curve analysis

7. **Model Deployment**
   - Save the best-performing model
   - Create an API to integrate the model into production

## Expected Outcomes
- A trained machine learning model that predicts telecom customer churn
- Key insights into factors influencing churn
- A deployable model that can provide real-time churn predictions
- Actionable recommendations for business retention strategies

## Learning Takeaways
- Understanding logistic regression for classification problems
- Handling missing values and feature engineering techniques
- Implementing and evaluating predictive models in R
- Applying hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
- Building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
