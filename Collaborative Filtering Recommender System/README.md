# Build a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System in Python

## Project Overview

Recommendation systems power the personalized experience we enjoy on platforms like Amazon, Netflix, and Spotify. In this project, you'll build a memory-based collaborative filtering recommender system using Python and the Amazon Reviews/Ratings dataset (2 million records). The goal is to suggest relevant products to users based on historical interactions of similar users or items—leveraging cosine similarity and nearest neighbors.
You’ll learn how to:
- Understand and implement collaborative filtering
- Build a user-item matrix
- Apply cosine similarity to measure user/item proximity
- Generate personalized recommendations at scale

## Dataset

**Source**: [Amazon Reviews and Ratings Dataset](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)  
**Records**: 2 Million+ user-product interactions  
**Key Attributes**:
- `userId`: Unique user identifier  
- `productId`: Unique product identifier  
- `rating`: User-provided rating  
- `timestamp`: When the rating was recorded  

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy`: Data manipulation  
  - `scikit-learn`: Cosine similarity, preprocessing  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`: Data visualization  
  - `scipy`: Distance calculations  

## Project Workflow

### 1.Data Loading & Exploration
- Load the dataset  
- Handle missing values  
- Understand rating distribution and user activity  

### 2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize most active users and frequently rated products  
- Plot rating trends  

### 3.Data Preprocessing
- Encode user and product IDs  
- Normalize ratings  
- Filter sparse data (users/items with very few interactions)  

### 4.Building User-Item Matrix
- Convert the dataset into a matrix where rows = users and columns = items  

### 5.Similarity Computation
- Compute **cosine similarity** between users (user-based) or items (item-based)  
- Use **K-Nearest Neighbors** to identify similar users/items  

### 6.Making Recommendations
- Predict ratings for unrated items  
- Recommend top-N products for a given user  

### 7.Evaluation
- Use RMSE or Precision@K to evaluate performance  
- Discuss cold-start and sparsity issues

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, you will:
- Build a fully functioning collaborative filtering recommender engine  
- Understand the tradeoffs between user-based and item-based filtering  
- Learn to deal with sparse data and performance bottlenecks  
- Be able to deploy similar systems for real-world applications in e-commerce or content platforms

- Cosine similarity and KNN in recommendation systems  
- Memory-based filtering (user-user & item-item)  
- Building and scaling a user-item interaction matrix  
- Dealing with cold-start problems and data sparsity
