# Machine Learning Project for Retail Price Optimization

## Overview

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to implement a **retail price optimization strategy** using **regression trees**. By analyzing historical sales data from a cafe, we estimate the **price elasticity of demand** for each product and calculate the **optimal price** to maximize revenue. This project is a foundational step in building a dynamic pricing engine suitable for retail businesses.

Key business insight: Understanding how sales volume responds to price changes enables businesses to price their products more intelligently, increasing both competitiveness and profitability.

## Dataset

The project uses real-world-inspired sales data from a cafe, stored across **three CSV files**:

1. **Cafe - Sell MetaData.csv**
   - Columns: `Sell ID`, `Sell Category`, `Item ID`, `Item Name`

2. **Cafe - Transaction - Store.csv**
   - Columns: `Calendar Date`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `Sell ID`, `Sell Category`

3. **Cafe - DateInfo.csv**
   - Columns: `Date`, `Year`, `Holiday`, `Weekend`, `School Break`, `Temperature`, `Outdoor`

**Data Source:** PostgreSQL database hosted on Amazon RDS  
**Access Method:** Fetched using the `psycopg2` Python library

## Project Workflow

### 1.Problem Understanding
- Define the pricing problem in the retail context
- Study price elasticity and its implications

### 2.Data Setup
- Load data from PostgreSQL using `psycopg2`
- Import necessary libraries and configure Jupyter for interactive coding

### 3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Merge and preprocess datasets
- Visualize transaction trends, pricing patterns, and seasonal effects
- Understand business context through visual insights

### 4.Data Preprocessing
- Clean and unify categorical and date fields
- Create derived features from `Calendar Date` and `Temperature`

### 5.Price Elasticity Modeling
- Implement regression models to estimate price elasticity for individual items
- Create generic code to automate elasticity computation across all products

### 6.Price Optimization
- Simulate different price points and their expected impact on demand
- Visualize revenue curves to identify optimal pricing
- Compare elastic vs. inelastic products

### 7.Model Evaluation
- Evaluate models using RÂ², residual analysis, and visual validation
- Refine models by selecting significant variables

### 8.Generic Optimization Pipeline
- Automate price optimization for all products in the dataset
- Generate a final list of optimal prices ready for business implementation
