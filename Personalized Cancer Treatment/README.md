# Genetic Mutation Classification for Personalized Cancer Treatment

## Overview

In this machine learning project, we classify genetic mutations based on medical literature into nine distinct classes. Personalized medicine aims to leverage genetic testing to tailor treatments for individual patients. However, the manual classification of genetic mutations is a time-intensive task that requires expert review of clinical literature. This project applies machine learning to automate this process, significantly reducing manual effort while maintaining accuracy.

By extracting features from medical literature data and training machine learning models, we aim to develop a system that accurately classifies genetic variations. This project explores multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of two main components: genetic variants and clinical text descriptions. It includes the following fields:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each record.
- **Gene**: The gene where the mutation is located.
- **Variation**: The amino acid change associated with the mutation.
- **Class**: The target classification (1-9) based on clinical evidence.
- **Training_text**: Clinical evidence used to classify the mutation.

### Data Source
The dataset has been compiled from clinical research and literature sources, representing real-world scenarios in genetic mutation classification.
